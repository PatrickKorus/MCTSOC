# MCTSOC: Monte Carlo Tree Search in Optimal Control

This repository contains a series of experiments involving Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms in the 
context of Optimal Control tasks. They are part of my Bachelor Thesis:

#### [An Evaluation of MCTS Methods for Continuous Control Tasks](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/muzero-general) 

In the first part of the experiments we look at pure mcts which uses 
[this implementation](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/mcts-general).
The second part uses several variations of [muzero-general](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general) which
can be found in the branches of [my fork](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/muzero-general). 


## Dependencies

All dependencies including the variations of [muzero](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/muzero-general) can be installed
by running

```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I recommend using a clean virtual environment, see conda.

## How to run

```python
# TODO: Explain how to run experiments
# TODO: Link to PDF
```

```shell script
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-xetex # maybe texlive-xetex suffices?
sudo apt install texlive-luatex
```
