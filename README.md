# MCTSOC: Monte Carlo Tree Search in Optimal Control

This repository contains a Series of Experiments involving Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms in the 
context of Optimal Control Tasks. They are Part of my Bachelor Thesis:

#### [An Evaluation of MCTS Methods for Continuous Control Tasks](link to pdf #TODO) 

Among the dependencies are several variations of [muzero-general](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general) which
can be found in the several branches of [my forg](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/muzero-general).

## Dependencies

All dependencies including the variations of [muzero](https://github.com/PatrickKorus/muzero-general) can be installed
by running

```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

```python
# TODO: explain how to run experiments
```
